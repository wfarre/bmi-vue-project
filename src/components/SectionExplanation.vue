          A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy weight
          may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2
          diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating
          ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally
          about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.
